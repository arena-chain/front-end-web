## 1. Architecture Overview

```
PERMANENT (created once, reused forever)
├── Catalog          → Game catalog (Valorant, LoL, CS2...)
├── Partnership      → Sponsors & partners
├── League           → Competition brand (VCT, LEC, ESL...)
└── LeagueRule       → Reusable ruleset templates

SEASONAL (created per season, per event)
├── Season           → One run of a league (VCT 2026 Season 1)
├── PrizePool        → Prize money for that season
├── SeasonTeam       → Team registration for that season
├── SeasonRoster     → Player roster snapshot for that season
├── Round            → Weekly/daily matchday grouping
├── Match            → Individual series (BO1/BO3/BO5)
├── CheckIn          → Pre-match check-in per match
├── Standings        → Live rank table for the season
├── Bracket          → Knockout bracket (if format = KNOCKOUT)
└── MatchDispute     → Post-match dispute/protest
```

**Key rule:** A `League` never has dates, status, or teams. It is just a brand.  
A `Season` is what has dates, teams, prize pools, and standings.

## 3. Permanent Entities (Create Once)

These entities are **created once** and never change per event. They are the foundation.

### Step 1 — Create Game Catalogs
```
POST /catalog
{
  "name": "Valorant",
  "teamSize": 5,
  "supportsTeams": true,
  "supportsSolo": false
}
```
Do this for each game: Valorant, League of Legends, CS2.

### Step 2 — Create Partners/Sponsors (optional)
```
POST /partnerships
{
  "name": "Red Bull",
  "logo": "https://...",
  "type": "Event Sponsor",
  "website": "https://redbull.com"
}
```

### Step 3 — Create League Rule Templates
One ruleset per game configuration. You can have multiple per game (e.g., "Valorant BO3 League", "Valorant BO5 Playoffs").
```
POST /league-rules
{
  "name": "Valorant Standard BO3",
  "gameId": "<catalog-id>",
  "formatType": "LEAGUE",
  "matchType": "BO3",
  "pointsWin": 3,
  "pointsLoss": 0,
  "maxTeams": 10,
  "maxForfeitsBeforeDisqualification": 2,
  "mapPool": ["Ascent", "Bind", "Haven", "Icebox", "Lotus", "Pearl", "Split"],
  "mapVetoEnabled": true,
  "mapVetoFormat": "BAN_PICK_BAN",
  "vetoFirstPick": "HIGHER_SEED",
  "overtimeConfig": {
    "enabled": true,
    "format": "SUDDEN_DEATH",
    "maxOvertimePeriods": 2
  }
}
```

### Step 4 — Create Leagues
```
POST /leagues
{
  "gameId": "<catalog-id>",
  "name": "VCT EMEA",
  "type": "CONTINENTAL",
  "region": "EMEA",
  "description": "Valorant Champions Tour EMEA",
  "logoUrl": "https://..."
}
```

---

## 4. Seasonal Entities (Created Per Season)

These are created **each new season** and link back to permanent entities.

The full order per season:

```
Season → PrizePool → SeasonTeam registrations → SeasonRosters
  → Rounds → Matches → CheckIns → [Match Results] → Standings
  → [Bracket if KNOCKOUT] → Close Season → Distribute Prizes
```

---

## 5. Creation Order — Step by Step

### Phase 1: Setup (Admin)
```
1. Create Season
2. Create PrizePool for Season
3. Open registration (Season status = PLANNED)
4. Teams register → SeasonTeam created
5. Teams submit rosters → SeasonRoster created + players added
6. Registration deadline arrives → lock all rosters
7. Activate Season → Season status = ONGOING
```

### Phase 2: Competition (Admin + Auto)
```
8.  Create Rounds (Round 1, Round 2, ...)
9.  Create Matches inside each Round
10. Create CheckIn for each Match (set deadline = scheduledStart - 30min)
11. Teams check in via their app
12. Match goes ONGOING
13. Admin reports game results → standings auto-updated
14. Repeat for all rounds
```

### Phase 3: Playoffs (Knockout format)
```
15. Generate Bracket (POST /brackets/generate) with seeded teams from standings
16. As each bracket match completes → POST /brackets/:seasonId/advance
17. Bracket auto-propagates winners to next round
```

### Phase 4: Close
```
18. All matches done → Close Season (PATCH /seasons/:id/close)
19. Mark Prize Pool as DISTRIBUTED
20. Archive standings
```

## 7. Prize Pool & Sponsorship System

### Source Types
| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PLATFORM` | ArenaChain funds the entire prize pool |
| `SPONSORED` | An external partner (Partnership entity) funds it |
| `MIXED` | Both platform + sponsor contribute |

### Distribution Array
Each entry defines how much a specific rank receives:
```json
{
  "distribution": [
    { "rank": 1, "amount": 5000, "percentage": 50 },
    { "rank": 2, "amount": 2500, "percentage": 25 },
    { "rank": 3, "amount": 1500, "percentage": 15 },
    { "rank": 4, "amount": 1000, "percentage": 10 }
  ]
}
```

### Lifecycle
```
PENDING → (admin confirms) → CONFIRMED → (season ends) → DISTRIBUTED
```

### Frontend Display
- Show prize breakdown below the standings table
- Show sponsor logo if `sponsorId` is populated (use `sponsorId.logo`)
- Show `DISTRIBUTED` badge when season is finished

---

## 8. Bracket System (Knockout)

### Generate Bracket
After standings are computed for the regular season (or when a pure KNOCKOUT format starts), seed the qualifying teams and generate the bracket:

```json
POST /brackets/generate
{
  "seasonId": "...",
  "format": "SINGLE_ELIMINATION",
  "seededTeamIds": ["team1", "team2", "team3", "team4", "team5", "team6", "team7", "team8"]
}
```

Teams are paired: seed 1 vs seed 8, seed 2 vs seed 7, etc.

### Slot IDs
- `R1S1` = Round 1, Slot 1 (seed 1 vs seed 8)
- `R1S2` = Round 1, Slot 2 (seed 2 vs seed 7)
- `R2S1` = Semi-final 1 (winner R1S1 vs winner R1S2)
- `R3S1` = Grand Final

### After Each Bracket Match
When a match in a bracket is completed, call:
```json
PATCH /brackets/:seasonId/advance
{
  "slotId": "R1S1",
  "winnerId": "team1-id",
  "matchId": "match-id"
}
```
The system automatically places the winner into `nextSlotId` and sets that slot to `READY` when both teams are assigned.

### Bracket UI Rendering
```
Round 1 (QF)          Round 2 (SF)        Round 3 (Final)
[Seed 1 vs Seed 8] →
                        [Winner → ]
[Seed 4 vs Seed 5] →               →       [CHAMPION]
                        [Winner → ]
[Seed 2 vs Seed 7] →
                        [Winner → ]
[Seed 3 vs Seed 6] →
```

Render by grouping `slots` by `roundNumber`. Status colors:
- `PENDING` → grey (TBD)
- `READY` → yellow (teams assigned, waiting for match)
- `COMPLETED` → green (winner set)
- `BYE` → blue (auto-advance)

---

## 9. Check-In System

### Purpose
Ensures both teams are online and ready 15-30 minutes before a match starts. If a team misses check-in, the match can be auto-forfeited.

### Typical Deadline
```
deadline = match.scheduledStart - 30 minutes
```

### Flow
```
1. Admin creates match
2. Admin creates check-in: POST /check-ins { matchId, seasonId, deadline }
3. Team 1 captain presses "Check In": POST /check-ins/:matchId/team/:team1Id?team1Id=:team1Id
4. Team 2 captain presses "Check In": POST /check-ins/:matchId/team/:team2Id?team1Id=:team1Id
5. When both checked in → status = BOTH_READY
6. Admin processes expired: POST /check-ins/process-expired
   → Teams that didn't check in get status TEAM1_MISSED or TEAM2_MISSED
   → Admin can then call forfeit on the match
```

### Check-In UI
Show a countdown timer to the deadline. Each team's status is shown as:
- Not checked in → Red dot
- Checked in → Green checkmark with timestamp

---

## 10. Season Roster System

### Purpose
Locks the official player roster for each team at the time of the registration deadline. After locking, no additions or removals are allowed.

### Flow
```
1. Team registers: POST /season-teams
2. Team creates roster: POST /season-rosters { seasonId, teamId }
3. Team adds players: POST /season-rosters/:seasonId/:teamId/players { playerId }
4. Repeat until roster is complete
5. Registration deadline arrives:
   PATCH /season-rosters/:seasonId/lock-all
   → All rosters with enough players get locked
6. Locked rosters cannot be modified
```

### Rules Enforced
- Cannot add player if `status = LOCKED`
- Cannot exceed `maxRosterSize` (default 8)
- Cannot lock if players count < `minRosterSize` (default 5)

### Roster UI
Show the roster as a list of player cards. During OPEN period, show add/remove buttons. After deadline, show a "LOCKED" badge.

---

## 11. Match Dispute System

### Purpose
Allows teams to formally protest the result of a completed match. An admin reviews and can overturn the result.

### Dispute Reasons
| Reason | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `CHEATING` | Evidence of hacks or exploits |
| `WRONG_RESULT` | Score was reported incorrectly |
| `NO_SHOW` | Opponent didn't appear |
| `TECHNICAL_ISSUE` | Server crash, disconnect |
| `RULE_VIOLATION` | Opponent broke rules |
| `OTHER` | Anything else |

### Flow
```
1. Team submits dispute: POST /match-disputes
   { matchId, seasonId, submittedByTeamId, reason, description, evidenceUrls: [] }
2. Admin sees it in queue: GET /match-disputes/pending
3. Admin opens review: PATCH /match-disputes/:id/review
4. Admin resolves: PATCH /match-disputes/:id/resolve
   { verdict: "ACCEPTED" | "REJECTED", adminNote: "...", resolvedByAdminId: "..." }
```

### Status Flow
```
PENDING → UNDER_REVIEW → ACCEPTED | REJECTED
```

> **Note:** The system does not auto-revert standings on ACCEPTED. An admin must manually call the match forfeit or correct the standings. This is by design for full control.

## 12. Match Flow — Full Lifecycle

```
SCHEDULED → ONGOING → COMPLETED
          ↘          ↗
           FORFEIT
           CANCELLED
```

### Reporting a BO3 Series (Valorant example)
```
# Game 1: Team A wins Ascent 13-7
PATCH /matches/:id/result
{ "gameNumber": 1, "winnerId": "teamA", "mapName": "Ascent", "team1Score": 13, "team2Score": 7 }

# Game 2: Team B wins Bind 13-11
PATCH /matches/:id/result
{ "gameNumber": 2, "winnerId": "teamB", "mapName": "Bind", "team1Score": 11, "team2Score": 13 }

# Game 3: Team A wins Haven 13-9
PATCH /matches/:id/result
{ "gameNumber": 3, "winnerId": "teamA", "mapName": "Haven", "team1Score": 13, "team2Score": 9 }

→ series score: teamA 2 – 1 teamB
→ match.status → COMPLETED
→ match.winnerId → teamA
→ standings auto-updated (teamA +3pts, teamB +0pts)
→ forfeit count checked → auto-disqualify if exceeded
```

### Reporting a Forfeit
```
PATCH /matches/:id/forfeit
{ "forfeitingTeamId": "teamB", "reason": "No-show" }
→ match.status → FORFEIT
→ standings auto-updated
→ SeasonTeam forfeit count incremented
→ If forfeit count >= maxForfeitsBeforeDisqualification → SeasonTeam → DISQUALIFIED
```

## 13. Season Timeline UI

The timeline bar spans from `season.startDate` to `season.endDate`.

### What to show on the timeline
```
[Registration Deadline]──────[Round 1]──[Round 2]──...──[Round N]──[Playoffs]──[Season End]
```

#### Data to fetch
```
GET /seasons/:id          → season dates, status
GET /rounds?seasonId=     → all rounds (startDate, endDate, status, roundNumber)
GET /prize-pools/by-season?seasonId= → prize pool info
GET /brackets/by-season?seasonId=    → if format = KNOCKOUT
```

#### Position calculation
```javascript
function getPositionPercent(date, seasonStart, seasonEnd) {
  const total = seasonEnd - seasonStart;
  const elapsed = date - seasonStart;
  return (elapsed / total) * 100;
}
```

#### Rendering rules
- **Rounds:** Each round = a segment block with width proportional to duration
- **Registration Deadline:** Vertical red line at `season.registrationDeadline`
- **Today marker:** Vertical blue line at `new Date()`
- **Completed rounds:** green fill
- **Active round:** yellow fill with pulse animation
- **Upcoming rounds:** grey fill
- **Season status badge:** show `PLANNED` / `ONGOING` / `FINISHED`
- **Prize amount:** display under season title if prize pool exists

## 15. Error Handling

### Common Error Codes
| Status | Code | Meaning | Action |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| 400 | BAD_REQUEST | Invalid data | Check request body |
| 409 | CONFLICT | Duplicate resource | E.g., team already registered |
| 404 | NOT_FOUND | Entity doesn't exist | Check IDs |
| 400 | `Season not PLANNED` | Tried to register after activation | Show error message |
| 400 | `Registration deadline has passed` | Registration window closed | Show deadline |
| 400 | `Season is full` | maxTeams reached | Show "waitlist" option |
| 400 | `Roster is locked` | Tried to modify after deadline | Inform user |
| 400 | `Roster has X players, minimum is Y` | Tried to lock too early | Prompt to add players |
| 409 | `Open dispute already exists` | Team submitted a second dispute | Show existing dispute |
| 409 | `Bracket already exists` | Generated bracket twice | Fetch existing bracket |

### Frontend Pattern
```javascript
try {
  const res = await api.post('/season-teams', payload);
  showSuccess('Team registered!');
} catch (err) {
  if (err.response?.status === 409) {
    showError('Team is already registered for this season.');
  } else if (err.response?.status === 400) {
    showError(err.response.data.message);
  } else {
    showError('Unexpected error. Please try again.');
  }
}
```
